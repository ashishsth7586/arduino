    "A random variable, is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon. There are two types of random variables. They are as follows:\n",
    "1. Discrete Random Variable\n",
    "2. Continuous Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Discrete Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "If a random variable can take one value from a finite set of values then such type of random variable is said to be __Discrete Random Variable.__\n",
    "Example: In case of dice experiment (Rolling a dice), the random variable say \"X\" is a discrete random variable as it can have only values among 6 values of dice faces which are {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n",
    "\n",
    "The _probability distribution_ of a discrete random variable is a list of probabilities associated with each of its possible values. It is also sometimes called the probability function or the probability mass function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a random variable X may take k different values, with the probability that $X = x_i$ defined to be $P(X = x_i) = p_i$. The probabilities $p_i$ must satisfy the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 0 < $p_i$ < 1 for each i\n",
    "2. $p_1$ + $p_2$ + ... + $p_k$ = 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose a variable X can take the values 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n",
    "The probabilities associated with each outcome are described by the following table:\n",

    "\n",
    "The probability that X is equal to 2 or 3 is the sum of the two probabilities: $P(X = 2 or X = 3) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7$. Similarly, the probability that Xis greater than 1 is equal to $1 - P(X = 1) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$, by the complement rule.\n",
    "This distribution may also be described by the probability histogram shown above.\n",

    "All random variables (discrete and continuous) have a ___cumulative distribution function___. It is a function giving the probability that the random variable X is less than or equal to x, for every value x. For a discrete random variable, the cumulative distribution function is found by summing up the probabilities.\n",

    "* The probability that X is less than or equal to 3 is 0.1+0.3+0.4 = 0.8, and \n",
    "* The probability that X is less than or equal to 4 is 0.1+0.3+0.4+0.2 = 1.\n",
