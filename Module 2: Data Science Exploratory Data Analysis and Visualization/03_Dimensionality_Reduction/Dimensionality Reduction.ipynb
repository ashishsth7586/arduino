    "In simple words , PCA is a method of extracting important features from a large set of features available in a data set. It extracts low dimensional set of features from a high dimensional data set with a motive to capture as much information as possible. With fewer crucial features, visualization also becomes much more meaningful. PCA is more useful when dealing with 3 or higher dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always performed on a __symmetic correlation or covariance matrix__. This means the matrix should be numeric and have standardized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a data set of dimension 300(m) x 50(n). m represents the number of observations and n represents number of features. Since we have a large n=50, there can be $n\\frac{(n-1)}{2}$ scatter plots i.e more than 1000 plots possible to analyze the variable relationship. Wouldn't it be a tedious job to perform exploratory data analysis on this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it would be a lucid approach to slect a subset of n (n << 50) features which captures as much information. Followd by plotting the observation in the resultant low dimensional space.\n",
